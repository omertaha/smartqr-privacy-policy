*Last updated: April 15, 2025*

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how SmartQR ("we", "our", or "app") collects, uses, and shares information when you use our mobile application. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it through our compliance with this policy.

## Information We Collect

### Information You Provide to Us

- **User Content**: QR codes you create or scan.
- **Settings and Preferences**: Your app settings and preferences.

### Information We Collect Automatically

- **Usage Data**: Information about how you use the app, including session duration, features used, and interactions.
- **Device Information**: Device type, operating system, and unique device identifiers.

### Permissions Required

- **Camera**: We require camera permission to scan QR codes. We do not store images captured by your camera; the camera is only used in real-time to detect and scan QR codes.
- **Storage**: To save QR codes you create, we may request access to your device's storage.

## How We Use Your Information

- Improve and develop the app
- Maintain functionality and stability
- Diagnose and fix technical issues
- Analyze usage patterns to enhance user experience

## Data Storage and Security

- **Local Storage**: Most information is stored locally on your device.
- **Cloud Services**: If you use features that require cloud storage (such as saving QR codes online), data is stored securely on our Firebase servers.
- **Security Measures**: We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information.

## Information Sharing and Disclosure

We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties except:

- With your consent
- When required by law
- To protect our rights or the safety of users
- With service providers who assist in delivering our services (such as cloud storage providers)

## Third-Party Services

Our app may use third-party services, including:

- Firebase (for analytics and storage)
- Google Mobile Ads
- In-App Purchase services

Each of these services has its own privacy policy and data collection practices. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third parties.

## Your Choices and Rights

You can:

- Disable camera permissions through your device settings (note that this will impact core app functionality)
- Delete locally stored QR codes and history
- Request deletion of any server-side data by contacting us

## Children's Privacy

Our app is not directed at children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated "Last Updated" date.
